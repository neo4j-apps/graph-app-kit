## Graph App Kit

Build Neo4j Graph Apps using components and utilities from this graph app kit.  
This kit should be considered to be 'under development' and the components in it can have breaking changes (i.e. until version `1.0.0` semver does not apply).

Browse source code and read README:s in sub directories for examples and docs.

## Install and import

```bash
npm install graph-app-kit --registry https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm

```

```javascript
import { Cypher, DriverProvider } from 'graph-app-kit/utils'

## Component playground / library

There's an interactive playground to view and modify the components.  
This is temporarily hosted at https://styleguide-oipiezsosg.now.sh.  
Feedback wanted!

To use the playground when developing components: `yarn playground` and to generate a static version to deploy: `yarn playground:build` (the artifacts end up in `styleguide/`)
